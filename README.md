# StructViz

StructViz is an application to visualize algorithms and data structures, 
making previously complex concepts more accessible. StructViz allows you to change various
settings to visualize large and small datasets at different speeds. Ideal for students, 
educators or even professionals looking for a visual representation of an algorithm or data structure.

## Motivation

Algorithms and data structures are notoriously hard to learn and teach, and for that reason I wanted
to aid the process by providing a visual representation for each of them. The application is open-source,
so you can easily see the source code and follow the actual code being run.

## Quick Start

```
1. git clone https://github.com/HarbourHeading/structviz.git
